  particularly with Angular, have honed my skills in building and migrating Angular applications, 
  specifically upgrading from AngularJS to Angular 16. This experience has deepened my understanding of Angularâ€™s architecture, 
  including module structure, components, and services. I also have substantial hands-on experience with state management libraries like NgRx and have successfully implemented advanced features using RxJS for reactive programming. 
  This complements my solid foundation in web technologies, 
  including HTML5 and SCSS, where I excel in transforming wireframes and UI/UX designs into functional, 
  pixel-perfect web pages.`;
